        <p>Feel free to explore my projects and academic experience. Thank you for visiting!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Thomas Allen. I am a Software Engineer and Game Developer based in San Diego, California.
            I recently completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University.
        </p>
        <p>
            I specialize in software engineering and gameplay programming with hands-on experience 
            building both personal and academic projects, as well as some professional experience. 
            Highlights include creating a 2D platformer from the ground up in 
            GameMaker Studio 2 and developing an NFL prediction tool in Python that integrates APIs, statistical models, 
            and a custom Tkinter GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion lies in solving problems through code, whether that’s optimizing a gameplay mechanic, 
            automating a workflow by creating modular code, or turning a concept into a polished product. 
            I thrive on learning new technologies, working collaboratively, and pushing myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am eager to apply my skills in C++, Python, and software development to professional projects 
            that challenge me to grow as both an engineer and a creative problem-solver.
        </p>
        <p>
