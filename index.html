        <p>Feel free to explore my projects and academic experience. Thank you for visiting!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Thomas Allen. I am a 26 Year Old Software Engineer and Game Developer based in San Diego, California.
            I recently completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University.
        </p>
        <p>
            I specialize in software engineering and gameplay programming with hands-on experience 
            building both personal and academic projects, as well as some professional experience. 
            Some Personal Projects include creating a 2D platformer from the ground up in 
            GameMaker Studio 2, developing an NFL prediction tool in Python that integrates APIs, statistical models, 
            and a custom Tkinter GUI, and creating a fun NFL Trivia Web App!
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion lies in solving problems through code, whether that’s optimizing a gameplay mechanic, 
            automating a workflow by creating modular code, or turning a concept into a polished product. 
            I thrive on learning new technologies, working collaboratively, and pushing myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am eager to apply my skills in C++, Python, and software development to professional projects 
            that challenge me to grow as both an engineer and a creative problem-solver.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for checking out my portfolio! Don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect.
